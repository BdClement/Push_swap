# Push_swap ðŸ§¹

Push Swap project is an algorithm exercise.    
I had to sort data in a stack using a second empty stack using defined instructions.  

It is an introduction with complexity notion.

I used an algorithm inspired by QuickSort, which has an O(nlogn) complexity.   
The list is divided into smaller, sorted parts before being merged back together.
